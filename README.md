Report 

 
The line graph that can be seen above presents information regarding the number of people that deposited and the month in which they deposited. According to the graph, the number of deposits is at its highest point in May, with 925, and it is at its lowest level in December, with 100. August, with a total of 688, was our second-highest performing month, followed by July, with 627. The graph also reveals that the summertime is a time of high deposit activity, which we can observe for ourselves.
The graph also demonstrates how stakeholders can understand which month of the year customers are more interested in subscribing to the term deposit.
Table
 
This table explains the trend from all years on the subscription for term deposits of all different ages. As we can see from the data there are more no than yes to the subscription plan for term deposit. The huge difference between them can depend upon more than one criterion such as educational background or age criteria or marital status. As we can see from the above table, there increment in the subscription of term deposit from the year 2017 to 2018 and vice-versa. We can absorb that from the year 2018 to 2019 both decreased because over this year compared to the previous year the people's participation is compared to less. 
From the indicators, we know that the we had highest deposits in the year 2018 and from the previous line chart we can also predict that the maximum subscription for the term deposit is in the month of May.
Box Plot
 
The boxplot shown above is between the columns Average Call Duration and Purchased. I chose Average call duration because there were a few outliers in the no area(i.e. the customer will not be interested in subscribing to term deposit). This will show that the customer has been talking for longer than 400 seconds. It's possible that he or she will sign up for the term payment.
From the above box plot, the stakeholders can know that if a customer takes time to talk on average of above 400 seconds it means the customer is likely to subscribe for the term deposit. But we need to consider another possibility that the customer took more time because he wants to sign up for the term deposit. 










Pie Chart
 
I constructed an age group column from the age column using the condition below.  "Young" <= 25 years old, "Youth" <= 40 years old, "Adult" <= 60 years old, and "Senior" >60 years old. The pie charts above only indicate people who have enrolled on the term deposit based on their age group. According to the data presented above, the age group youth is more interested in term deposits than the age group adults, followed by senior persons, and last but not least, the young age group. The young age group is least interested in term deposits subscription.
From the pie chart stakeholders can get to know what age group of people all these years are more interested in taking a subscription for term deposit. 
Table
 

The above table is divided into four categories: housing loan, marital status, personal loan, and age group. The youth age group that does not have housing or a personal loan is very interested in term deposits, possibly because they are investing money for their future. Second, adults are the age group that invests in term deposits. Finally, because they have only recently begun their careers, young people are the least affected. 
Then there is a housing loan but no personal loan. We can deduce that young people have made the largest deposit, followed by adults, and lastly seniors.   
Then there's the matter of having a personal loan but no housing loan. Once again, the youth have increased their subscription to term deposits. 
According to the above table, regardless of their personal and home loan, the age of young people and adults is more invested in term deposits than the other categories.    
Bar Chart
 
The above bar graph tells us which month of the year has the highest deposits from all the different ages.  We can see that in the year 2017, we have the highest term deposits in the month of July, August and May. Among all the 3 months July month has the highest subscription. In the Year 2018, May, April, July and August have more term deposits. In the following year, we have July, August, May, and April have the maximum subscription for term deposits.
From the above graph, stakeholders can get information on which month of the year has the highest term deposits in the year and they can also get to know the maximum subscription year which is 2018 and the least subscription in the year 2019. It is also evident that the month of May, July, and August have the highest term deposits in the year.  












Dashboard
 

The above will give details of the number of people who purchased the term deposit subscription. The line chart will give the overall purchased term deposit every month for a year. We found during May, July and August have maximum term deposits people purchased. From the pie chart, we have four different categories which are youth, young, adult, and senior. Among these 4 categories, Youth and Adults have a Maximum subscription for term deposits. The table represents whether people who purchased the term deposit have a housing and personal loan and which age group has more deposits. We get to know that irrespective of the loanâ€™s youth, and adult age groups are getting term deposits. The other table will give details of the number of people subscribed and unsubscribed over the years. It can absorb that year 2018 has the highest term deposit subscription. The box plot will give that customer who speaks more time and is likely to accept the term deposit.  The bar chart will give the maximum term deposits in a month each year. 
This dashboard will provide information on the number of term deposits, the types of clients they have, whether they have any loans, what the average call duration is if the customer wants to subscribe, and which months and years have the the biggest term deposit subscription.

Developing Visuals and Process:
In developing the visuals for the dataset, I started by carefully analyzing the data to identify key trends and patterns. I used various visualization techniques such as line graphs, bar charts, pie charts, and box plots to represent different aspects of the dataset. The line graph provided a clear picture of the monthly deposit trends over the years, while the pie charts helped visualize the distribution of term deposits based on age groups and other factors. One of the challenges I encountered was handling the categorical variables in almost every column in the bank marketing dataset because I need to create additional calculation columns to find the values and make decisions on how to handle missing values to ensure the visualizations accurately represented the available information.

Insights Derived:
1. Seasonal Trend: The line graph showed that the summer months, particularly May, July, and August, had the highest number of term deposits. This suggests that there may be seasonal patterns in the customers' willingness to subscribe to term deposits.
2. Age Group Preferences: The pie charts revealed that the youth and adult age groups showed the highest interest in term deposits, while the young age group displayed the least interest.
3. Impact of Loans: The analysis of customers with different housing and personal loan combinations highlighted that individuals without housing and personal loans, especially in the youth and adult age groups, were more inclined to subscribe to term deposits.
4. Average Call Duration: The box plot indicated that customers with an average call duration of more than 400 seconds were more likely to subscribe to term deposits. This metric could potentially be used as an indicator of interest in the product.

Audience Persona - Stakeholders:
As my chosen audience persona is stakeholders, the visuals were designed to provide them with clear and actionable insights into the data. Stakeholders, such as bank executives, marketing teams, and product managers, need to make informed decisions to improve customer engagement and increase term deposit subscriptions.

Visuals to Drive Stakeholder Action: 
1. Which months have the largest amount of term deposit subscriptions? This information can be used by stakeholders to organize focused marketing campaigns and promotional activities during peak months.
2. Which age groups are most interested in term deposits? Understanding the preferences of the target population enables stakeholders to customize their marketing strategy and product offerings.
3. What effect do loans have on term deposit subscriptions? Stakeholders can develop individualized marketing strategies by identifying consumer segments with various loan profiles.
4. Is it possible to anticipate term deposit interest based on average call duration? Call duration data can be used by stakeholders to identify potential leads and prioritize follow-ups.

Overall, the visualizations and insights obtained from the dataset are meant to equip stakeholders with the knowledge they need to make data-driven choices, maximize marketing initiatives, and raise consumer satisfaction with term deposit products. Stakeholders can design tailored strategies to effectively attract and keep customers by studying the tastes and behaviours of their target audience.
